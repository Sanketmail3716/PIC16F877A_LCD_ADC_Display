# PIC16F877A_LCD_ADC_Display
This project reads analog data from channel 0 of the PIC16F877A microcontroller using its inbuilt ADC and displays the digital value on a 16x2 LCD. It uses MikroC PRO for PIC with 4-bit LCD interface and provides real-time analog sensor monitoring, ideal for embedded system beginners and hobby projects.
